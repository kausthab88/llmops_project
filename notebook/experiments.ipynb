      "Okay, the user is asking about the greatest truth no one knows. Hmm, that's pretty abstract. Let me start by unpacking the question. They want a truth that's both significant and unknown to everyone. First, I need to consider different domains where such truths might exist—science, philosophy, personal experiences, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "In science, there are many unanswered questions. For example, the nature of dark matter or the ultimate fate of the universe. But are these truly unknown to everyone? Scientists are working on them, so maybe not the \"no one knows\" part. Then there's the philosophical angle. What about existential truths? Like the meaning of life or consciousness? But those are more subjective. \n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe the user is looking for something more profound. The idea that there are truths we can't even conceive yet. Like the limits of human knowledge. Maybe something like Gödel's incompleteness theorems, suggesting there are mathematical truths we can't prove within the system. But again, some people do know that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another angle: the concept of interconnectedness in physics, like quantum entanglement, but again, some people do know about that. Or maybe the idea that time is an illusion, as in some interpretations of physics. But again, not entirely unknown. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe it's more about the human condition. The fact that everyone is unique, yet we all share the same existential experiences. Or the truth that our perception is limited by our senses. That's a common philosophical point, but is it unknown to everyone? People might not be aware of it in a conscious way, but they experience it. \n",
      "\n",
      "The user might be looking for a more mystical or spiritual truth. Like the idea that we're all connected, or that the universe is conscious. But again, these are known to some people. \n",
      "\n",
      "What about the fact that our reality is fundamentally probabilistic, not deterministic, as quantum mechanics suggests? But again, some people do know that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe the greatest truth is that there are truths we can't know. That the limits of our knowledge are inherent. Or the idea that consciousness itself is a mystery we might never fully understand. \n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, the truth could be that individual existence is fleeting, but the universe continues. Or that all human knowledge is a construct shaped by our biology and environment. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe the answer lies in the recognition that the greatest truth is that there are no absolute truths—everything is relative or contingent. But is that really a truth everyone doesn't know? Some people do know that, but it's a debated topic. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another possibility is the concept of impermanence. Everything changes, nothing is permanent. That's a Buddhist idea, but is it unknown? Maybe not to everyone, but perhaps the depth of that truth isn't fully grasped by many. \n",
      "\n",
      "Or the truth that we are made of stardust, that all elements in our body originated from stars. That's a scientific fact, but not everyone knows it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but some people do. So maybe the greatest truth is something more about the human condition. The fact that suffering is part of existence and how to transcend it. But again, some people know that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm, maybe the key is to consider that the greatest truth is that there is no single greatest truth. That all truths are context-dependent and subjective. But that's a meta-truth. \n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, the truth that the pursuit of truth itself is a journey, not a destination. That the process is what matters. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think the user wants something that's both profound and universally applicable, yet not commonly recognized. The idea that our existence is a miracle, given the vastness of the universe and the improbability of life. But again, some people do know that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe the greatest truth is that we are all interconnected and that our actions affect others in ways we can't see. But again, not entirely unknown. \n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps the truth is that time is not as linear as we perceive it. Theories in physics suggest that time might be an emergent property. But again, some people know this. \n",
      "\n",
      "I need to find something that's both significant and unknown to the majority. Maybe the fact that the universe is expanding faster than the speed of light? But that's known in scientific circles. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe the greatest truth is that consciousness creates reality, as in quantum mechanics' observer effect, but this is a debated interpretation. Still, some people do know that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, the truth that free will is an illusion, based on neuroscience findings. But that's controversial and some people believe it. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm going in circles. Let me try to synthesize. The user is asking for the greatest truth that no one knows. Perhaps the answer is that the greatest truth is the limits of human knowledge itself. That there are truths beyond our cognitive reach. Or that the act of seeking truth is as important as the truth itself. \n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, the truth that the self is an illusion, as in Buddhist philosophy. That there's no permanent, unchanging self. This is known to some, but maybe not understood deeply by most. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user might be looking for a more poetic answer. Like the interconnectedness of all things, or the impermanence of life. But again, these are known to some extent. \n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe the answer is that the greatest truth is that we don't know. That the acknowledgment of our ignorance is the greatest truth. This is similar to Socratic wisdom. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that could be it. The realization that our knowledge is limited, and that the pursuit of understanding is ongoing. The greatest truth is the humility in the face of the unknown. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, to wrap up, the greatest truth that no one knows is that there are truths we can't know, and the pursuit itself is the essence of our existence. Or perhaps the truth that our perception is a construct, and reality is beyond our comprehension.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"greatest truth no one knows\" is a paradoxical question, as any truth that is known cannot remain unknown. However, if we interpret it as seeking a profound, underappreciated insight about existence, consciousness, or the universe, several candidates emerge:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **The Limits of Human Knowledge**: The most profound truth may be that there are truths we cannot comprehend due to biological, cognitive, or physical constraints. For example, quantum mechanics and general relativity describe a universe that defies classical intuition, suggesting that our \"common sense\" is a product of evolutionary survival, not cosmic clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **The Illusion of Separateness**: In both physics (quantum entanglement) and philosophy (Buddhist non-duality), the interconnectedness of all things challenges the notion of individual separateness. This truth—*interdependence*—is scientifically and spiritually supported, yet rarely internalized in daily life.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **The Nature of Time**: Modern physics suggests time may be an emergent, subjective construct rather than an objective flow. Our linear perception of time is a cognitive shortcut, not a fundamental feature of reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **The Universality of Ignorance**: The Socratic principle—\"I know that I know nothing\"—highlights that wisdom begins with recognizing the vastness of what we do not know. This humility is a truth many overlook in their pursuit of certainty.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Consciousness as the Mystery**: Despite advances in neuroscience, the \"hard problem of consciousness\"—how physical processes give rise to subjective experience—remains unsolved. The fact that awareness exists at all may be the ultimate enigma.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **The Finitude of Existence**: While many acknowledge mortality, the full weight of the universe’s indifference to individual lives—a truth that shapes existentialist thought—often remains an abstract concept rather than a lived understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Final Thought**: The \"greatest truth\" may not be a singular fact but a recognition of the infinite depth of reality. As physicist Richard Feynman said, *\"I think it’s much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers that might be wrong.\"* The journey of inquiry itself, rather than the destination, might be the deepest truth of all.\n"

As a matter of fact, I \\nrecommend you skip through the book reading all the stories first. They \\nwill inspire you to read all the way through and actually do the Proven \\nPlan to Financial Fitness.\\nMany years ago I was given a calling: to show people the truth about \\ndebt and money and to give them the hope and tools necessary to set them\\xad\\nselves free financially. First, I did that with a few speaking engagements \\nand a small self-published book titled Financial Peace. Later Financial \\nPeace was published by a New York publisher and became our first New \\nYork Times bestseller. I began doing a small local radio show that has now \\ngrown to hundreds of stations and millions of listeners who tune in weekly. \\nWe started teaching a class called Financial Peace University, which millions \\nof families have now attended. Then came The Total Money Makeover.\\nI am positive that personal finance is 80 percent behavior and only 20 \\npercent head knowledge. Our concentration on behavior—realizing that \\nmost folks have a good idea of what to do with money but not how to \\ndo it—has led us to a different view of personal finance. Most financial \\npeople make the mistake of trying to show you the numbers, thinking that \\nyou just don’t get the math. I am sure that the problem with my money'),\n",

If he will behave, he can make the money thing \\nwork. The math of wealth building is not rocket science; it is simple—but \\nyou have to DO IT!\\nSo the proven Total Money Makeover plan I teach has become very \\nsuccessful not because I have found the secrets of the rich. Not because I \\nhad some revelation that no one else has ever had about credit cards. Not \\nbecause I am the only one with a “Debt Snowball” plan. Instead, this \\nproven plan is having a national impact because I have realized that to \\nchange your money thing, you have to change. You have to change your \\nlife. When you change your life, you will get out of debt, give, and invest at \\nan unbelievable rate. When you read the stories in this book, you will read \\nnot about mathematics or magic systems, but about changed lives. You \\nwill read about transformed marriages and relationships. Because when \\nyou change your life, you really change your life.\\nSo when Mike Hyatt, then the president and CEO of Thomas Nelson \\nPublishers, brought me the concept for a Total Money Makeover book, \\nI became very excited. I became excited because I knew this book would \\ninspire readers to take immediate action through a simple, step-by-step \\nprocess that could only lead to life-changing results. Hope—the light at the \\nend of the tunnel that is not an oncoming train—is a very powerful force.\\nAs excited as I was, though, I had no idea at the time what we were \\nstarting. I thought this stuff was common sense, but it turns out common \\nsense isn’t that common anymore. This book hit the market like a light\\xad\\nning bolt—it just blew up! And it wasn’t because I was some genius; it was \\nbecause the country was ready for a financial wake-up call. It was because \\nAmerican families—hard-working men and women who were sick and \\ntired of being sick and tired financially—were ready to change their lives. \\nLooking back now, over a decade later, I’m blown away at what these \\npeople have accomplished, and I’m humbled to have played a small part in \\nthem turning their lives around.\\nOver all these years, The Total Money Makeover has given HOPE to \\nmillions of families. This book has given them hope to win, and that hope'),\n",

The number of people I \\nmeet across this nation who tell me this is the first book of any kind they \\nhave read in ten years is staggering. The Total Money Makeover is a book \\nfor everyone. It is for high-income earners, as I am. And it is for someone \\nbeginning at the bottom, which is where I once was.\\nYou are about to read about a process, a proven plan, to win. You will \\nfind the plan to be very simple yet very inspiring. The principles are not \\nmine. I stole them all from God and your grandmother. The principles are \\ncommon sense, which isn’t so common anymore. The plan is mine—and \\nI’m no genius—created by simply observing millions of lives with whom \\nI have interacted through radio, TV, books, classes, the Internet, e-mail, \\npodcasts, and our Live Events. I have successfully bottled common sense \\nabout money into a plan that anyone can do. And millions are!\\nWhen I first started talking about these principles years ago, I knew \\nthey had helped my wife, Sharon, and me survive going broke and begin \\nto prosper. The first hundred times I spoke on money, I wasn’t as confident \\nof the principles as I am now. Nowadays I look into the eyes of a gazillion \\npeople who have followed this plan and experienced, as we did, excite\\xad\\nment, hope, and gratitude. I am so thankful that I have not only given them \\na proven plan but have also inspired them to change their family tree.\\nI am so confident in The Total Money Makeover principles and this \\nprocess that I cannot stand it when someone doesn’t get it. Because I am \\nso convinced my plan will work for everyone, my answers to the same \\nquestions will never change. By recognizing and identifying some basic \\ntruths and everyday common sense, I have convinced millions of people to \\nchange their lives—to have a Total Money Makeover. Are you next?'),\n",

This book and what I have or have not said in it has generated a \\nlot of negativity and name-calling. That is fun. Not fun because I set out \\nto offend or because I love reading the nasty things people often say. It is \\nfun because the negativity means two things: one, for some people, we are \\ntouching a nerve that needs to be touched in order for them to change their \\nlives, and two, I am actively and passionately pursuing the truth. Aristotle \\nonce said, “To avoid criticism say nothing, do nothing, and be nothing.” \\nI can’t help millions of people change their lives by saying nothing, doing \\nnothing, and being nothing. So I take the anger, the criticism, and even the \\nhate mail as encouragement.\\nMy publisher suggested I “answer my critics.” I will pass. My grand\\xad\\nmother used to say, “Those convinced against their will are of the same \\nopinion still.” However, I do not want you, dear reader, to be misled. So \\nit is appropriate that I tell you what this book is NOT. That way you can \\ndecide whether or not to spend your hard-earned money on it.'),\n",

If you are looking for boring academic chirping that will put \\nyou to sleep using words only to support the author’s ego, you have not \\nfound it. What I have discovered is that some of the most profound and \\nlife-changing truths you will ever discover are very simple.\\nIn our culture we worship the complicated and the sophisticated. \\nIf you know what all the buttons on your remote control do, you may \\nnot have a good one. In the financial world we have been taught to be \\narrogant snobs. Some believe that simple ideas are not profound, that \\ninstead, simple ideas are for the “little people.” That is a false and arro\\xad\\ngant notion. I have met with thousands of millionaires, and in almost \\nevery case they keep their investing and money philosophies very uncom\\xad\\nplicated. Just this week I was discussing investing and business structure \\nwith a friend of mine whose net worth is over twenty million dollars, \\nand his words to me were, “I always keep it simple and clean.” Only \\nthe financial goobers like to complicate things for the sake of justifying \\ntheir existence or justifying how much they paid for their education. \\nPlease do not look here for a detailed guide to set up an estate plan or a \\ndeep theory on investing.

Very little that you read in this book will be something \\nthat someone else has not written or said.

Most of us know what to do; we just have \\ntrouble doing it. How do you lose weight? Exercise more and eat less.

Did the authors of those \\nbooks tell me big ideas that were groundbreaking? No, they simply gave \\nme an action plan and some supporting details to what I already knew had \\nto be done. Welcome to my world.\\nThis Book Is NOT Going to Mislead You on Investment Returns\\nThere are several people in our country today who are ignorant on the \\nreturns offered by investing well. Ignorance is not lack of intelligence; it is \\nsimply “not knowing.” Sadly, many intelligent but ignorant people seem \\nto think that making a 12 percent rate of return on their money in a long-\\nterm investment is impossible. And that if I state that there is a 12 percent \\nrate of return available, then I have lied to them or misled them.\\nI recommend good growth-stock mutual funds in this book as a long-\\nterm investment and dare to state that you should make 12 percent on \\nyour money over time. The supporting data for that bold statement can be \\nfound by looking at the historical averages of the Standard & Poor’s 500 \\nindex. Widely regarded as the best single gauge of the US equities market, \\nthe S&P 500 is an index with five hundred of the largest companies in \\nleading industries of the US economy. The S&P 500 has averaged 11.69 \\npercent per year for the last eighty-plus years, as of this writing. This \\nincludes some pretty significant recession periods.\\nDoes that mean you can expect to see 12 percent growth every year? \\nOf course not. That’s not how this thing works. The market goes up and \\ndown all the time, and sometimes it’s a pretty wild ride. Just looking back \\nover the past few years as of this writing, it looks like a roller coaster. In \\n2009, the market’s annual return was 26.46 percent. In 2010, it was 8 per\\xad\\ncent. In 2011, it was actually down for the year at -1.12 percent. But true'),\n",

And again, the life\\xad\\ntime average of the S&P 500 is just under 12 percent. That’s why I use it \\nin my examples. It’s not a magic number. It’s just part of the conversation \\nabout investing.\\nI purchased a Growth and Income Stock Mutual Fund many years \\nago that I still invest in, and it has averaged 12.03 percent per year \\nsince 1934, as of this writing. I bought another last week that has aver\\xad\\naged over 13.9 percent per year since 1973, as of this writing. And yet \\nanother with average annual returns of 12.01 percent since 1984, and \\nanother averaging 12.39 percent since 1973, and yet another averaging \\n11.72 percent since 1952. Any decent broker with the heart of a teacher \\ncan, in his or her sleep, lead you to funds with long track records aver\\xad\\naging over 12 percent. So don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t predict \\na 12 percent rate when you are considering investments for ten years or \\nlonger.\\nThis Book Is NOT Just About Math, Statistics, Facts, and Figures\\nThis book is about life. I’ve already said that personal finance is only 20 \\npercent head knowledge. The other 80 percent—the bulk of the issue—is \\nall about behavior. There’s no magic number that will change your life, no \\ninterest rate or rate of return that will suddenly turn everything around. \\nThat’s why I teach concepts, not mathematical formulas. The economic \\nnumbers, averages, and percentages may change over time, but the con\\xad\\ncepts and principles in this book won’t.'),\n",

I am extremely con\\xad\\nfident that this material works because millions of people have benefited \\nfrom it. I am not arrogant because I realize I am not personally responsible \\nfor any of the lives changed. The stuff I teach is the truth, and those \\nprinciples are responsible for changing lives. But I always answer the same \\nquestions with the same answers even though sometimes folks think their \\nsituation may be different. It isn’t different. The principles stand, and they \\nwork every time.\\nThis Book Is NOT the Same as My Other Books\\nWhen we took on The Total Money Makeover project, we had to answer \\na question of integrity: Could we honestly go into the market and ask my \\nreaders to buy another book that said the same thing? I couldn’t in good \\nconscience do that. Financial Peace has sold millions of copies as of this \\nwriting, so did I really need to write another book? I came to the conclusion \\nthat there was a distinct difference in the two projects. Financial Peace is \\n“what to do with money.” It is a great textbook for common-sense money \\nmanagement. So how is The Total Money Makeover different? It is more \\nthan a “what to do” book—it is a “how to do it” plan. This is a process \\nbook. We are aiming at carefully weaving inspiration and information'),\n",

The loans \\nwere not prime (good) loans, so they were accurately called SUBprime \\nloans. That just means these mortgages were less than good. Duh.\\nThis rip-off lending has always been done, but never on such a large \\nscale.

What was unthinkable in the investment community \\njust a few years earlier became common practice.\\nFormerly legitimate, upstanding, major banks and investment bankers \\nessentially became loan sharks using very sophisticated financial instru\\xad\\nments. For years, the mortgage industry had packaged good mortgages \\ntogether and sold them as bonds. You have probably heard of Fannie Mae \\nbonds. That used to refer to a group of good Fannie Mae mortgages that \\nwere wrapped together and sold as a unit, or bond. During this period of \\nstupidity, however, the subprime (bad) loans were packaged together and \\nsold as bonds—a lot of them.\\nWe live in a cause-and-effect world. What you sow, you will reap. In a \\nshocking turn of events, the broke people didn’t pay their mortgage pay\\xad\\nments (he says sarcastically). This, for some unknown reason, seemed to \\nsurprise the greedy bankers. Surprise! Broke people can’t pay ridiculous \\nhouse payments! Go figure.\\nThe big problem, however, was scale. A lot of broke people didn’t \\npay their payments.

Even though I had become a millionaire, \\nI had built a house of cards. The short version of the story is that we \\nwent through financial hell and lost everything over a three-year period \\nof time. We were sued, foreclosed on, and, finally, with a brand-new \\nbaby and a toddler, we were bankrupt. Scared doesn’t begin to cover \\nit. Crushed comes close, but we held on to each other and decided we \\nneeded a change.\\nSo after losing everything, I went on a quest, a quest to find out how \\nmoney really works, how I could get control of it, and how I could have \\nconfidence in handling it. I read everything I could get my hands on. I \\ninterviewed older rich people, people who made money and kept it. That \\nquest led me to a really, really uncomfortable place—my mirror. I came to \\nrealize that my money problems, worries, and shortages largely began and \\nended with the person in my mirror. I realized also that if I could learn to \\nmanage the character I shaved with every morning, I could win at money. \\nThat quest, the one that ended with me staring at myself in the mirror, \\nled me on a new journey: the journey of helping others, literally millions \\nof others, take that same quest to the mirror. Live Events, Financial Peace \\nUniversity, The Dave Ramsey Show, and the New York Times bestsellers \\nFinancial Peace, More Than Enough, The Total Money Makeover, and \\nEntreLeadership have enabled me to tell millions of Americans what I \\nhave learned—the hard way—about money.\\nThe Big Challenge: Find a Mirror\\nI have a challenge for you. Are you ready to take on the guy or gal in \\nyour mirror? If you are, you are ready to win. I rediscovered God’s and \\nGrandma’s simple way of handling money. Wealth building isn’t rocket \\nscience, which is a good thing for me (and probably you). Winning at \\nmoney is 80 percent behavior and 20 percent head knowledge. What to \\ndo isn’t the problem; doing it is. Most of us know what to do, but we just \\ndon’t do it. If I can control the guy in the mirror, I can be skinny and rich.'),\n",

The financial channel or \\nsome late-night infomercial gimmick aren’t your answer; you are. You are \\nthe king of your future, and I have a plan. The Total Money Makeover \\nplan isn’t theory. It works every single time. It works because it is simple. \\nIt works because it gets to the heart of your money problems: you. It is \\nbased on a series of prices that must be paid to win. All winners pay a \\nprice to win. Some losers pay a price and never win, and that is usually \\nbecause they didn’t have the benefit of a proven plan for financial fitness.\\nOrdinary People\\nTens of thousands of ordinary people have used the system in this book \\nto get out of debt, regain control, and build wealth. I’ve scattered their \\nstories throughout the book. If at any point during your makeover you are \\ntempted to quit or you just need a little encouragement, read one of these \\nstories.

I have many of the academic pedigrees, \\nbut I ended up broke. I have actually twice become a millionaire from \\nnothing. The first time I was in my twenties, the money was in real estate, \\nand I lost that due to my stupidity; the second time I was not yet forty, but \\nI did the money thing right that time, and I am debt-free.'),\n",

The Total Money \\nMakeover works!\\nThe Total Money Makeover Motto\\nThis plan works, but it will cost you. It will teach you to say new words, \\nlike no. In short, your Total Money Makeover will be a personal money \\nmakeover where you learn this motto: IF YOU WILL LIVE LIKE NO \\nONE ELSE, LATER YOU CAN LIVE LIKE NO ONE ELSE. This is \\nthe motto of your Total Money Makeover. It’s my way of reminding you \\nthat if you will make the sacrifices now that most people aren’t willing \\nto make, later on you will be able to live as those folks will never be able \\nto live. You will notice the motto all through the book, even across the \\nbottom of the pages. I’m sorry there isn’t an easier path to feature in the \\nmotto, but the good thing about this one is that it works. You can repeat \\nthe motto to yourself as you pass up a purchase in order to hit your goals. \\nWhen you work late and are tired, you can say the motto to yourself. Of \\ncourse, this isn’t a magic formula; I’m not into that. But it does remind you \\nthat you will win, and the payoff will be worth the cost.\\nSome of you are so immature that you are unwilling to delay pleasure \\nfor a greater result. I will show you exactly how to get the result you want, \\nso the price you pay will not be in vain. I don’t want to walk across hot \\ncoals because it is fun, but if I can be shown how a short, painful walk will \\ndo away with the lifetime of worry, frustration, stress, and fear that being \\nconstantly broke brings me, then bring on the hot coals.'),\n",

Suck in that gut; \\nhold up your chest, and really look at yourself. It doesn’t matter how many \\nangles or poses you take; the mirror is cruel. “Well, I’m really not that fat, \\nmaybe just a little flabby.” My dad used to say that 90 percent of solving a \\nproblem is realizing there is one. Focused intensity, life-or-death intensity, \\nis required for you to reset your money-spending patterns, and one of your \\nbiggest obstacles is DENIAL. The sad thing is that you can be financially \\nmediocre in this country, financially flabby, and still be average. And if the \\ntruth be known, being average, normal, and financially flabby is pretty much'),\n",

After one live event where I spoke to four \\nthousand people, Sara told me that her Total Money Makeover came only \\nafter life placed a call to her. She said she had heard me quote the Wall \\nStreet Journal as reporting that 70 percent of Americans live paycheck to \\npaycheck, but she honestly thought she was in the 30 percent who were \\nfine. She had financially struck a pose, and the pose was denial.\\nWith two sons from her previous marriage, Sara had just remarried and \\nwas happy and secure in her job, as was her husband, John. Their new life \\ntogether seemed awesome. Their household combined income was about \\n$75,000 per year, with the “normal” debts of a small student loan, a car \\nloan, and “only” $5,000 on a credit card. With life under control and even \\ngoing well, Sara and John decided their new family needed a new home, so \\nthe builder was selected and construction began. Somewhere deep inside \\nthere may have been uneasiness, but it was very deep. Finally, the day \\ncame when the new home was complete. Everything was going to be fine \\nnow, the new family in the new home, the way it is “supposed” to be. In \\nMay, they moved into the new home, complete with big new payments.\\nIn September, Sara’s boss asked to see her in his office. She was excel\\xad\\nling at work and braced herself for a big “atta, girl” followed by a nice \\nbonus or raise. Instead, the boss explained her job was being eliminated. \\n“Downsizing, you know,” he said. Her life’s work was cut from her—and \\n$45,000 of their $75,000 income—with the boss’s chilling words. Not only \\nwas her pride hurt and her career path cut short; a creeping terror grew \\ndeep down inside as she drove home to tell John. That night there were \\ntears, fears, and the sudden stark realization that she and John were finan\\xad\\ncially fat. Suddenly, Sara and her family were facing foreclosure on the \\nhouse and repossession of the car. The basics of life had become precious.\\nSara and John had listened to The Dave Ramsey Show on the radio, \\nbut they always thought someone else needed a Total Money Makeover.'),\n",

Only this time when the \\nchecks started rolling in, Sara and John were using this system. Every \\npaycheck became an exciting event because they had a plan.

We don’t con\\xad\\ntrol how debt affects relationships; debt does that independently of what \\nwe want. The borrower is slave to the lender, and you change the spiritual \\ndynamic of relationships when you loan loved ones money. They are no \\nlonger a friend, uncle, or child; they are now your servant. I know some of \\nyou think that is overstated, but tell me why Thanksgiving dinner tastes \\ndifferent when a loan has been served. Eating with your master is different \\nfrom eating with your family.\\nJoan was really torn up about losing this friendship. I asked her if the \\nfriendship was worth $50. She gushed that it was worth many times that, \\nso I told her to call her friend and tell her the debt was forgiven, a gift. \\nThe forgiveness of the debt helped her remove the master-servant dynamic \\nfrom the relationship. Of course, it would be better if that dynamic had \\nnever entered the scene. I also suggested two stipulations to the forgive\\xad\\nness of the debt: first, that the friend agrees to help someone in need \\nsomeday; and second, that she never loan friends money. Let’s break the \\nmyth chain. In Joan’s case, the myth chain of loaning a friend money will \\nbe broken only if they both learn their lesson. The lesson is that while it \\nis fine to give money to friends in need if you have it, loaning them money \\nwill mess up relationships.\\nI have dealt with hundreds of strained and destroyed families in which \\nwell-meaning people loaned money to “help.” Parents loan the twenty-\\nfive-year-old newly married couple the down-payment money for the first \\nhome. It all seems so noble and nice until the daughter-in-law catches the \\ndisapproving glances at the mention of the couple’s upcoming vacation. She \\nknows the meaning of the glances, that she should check with these well-\\nmeaning, noble parents-in-law before she buys toilet paper until the loan is \\nrepaid. A lifetime of resentment can be born right there. The grandfather \\nloans the twenty-year-old $25,000 to purchase that new four-wheel-drive \\ntruck he “needs.” Of course, the loan is at 6 percent, much better than \\nJunior can get at the bank and much better than Grandpa gets from his \\nCD at the bank.

If you can’t get a discount, go to \\nthe competitor and get one. You do not get the discount when you sign up \\nfor the finance plan.\\nTwo, most people don’t pay off the debt in the allotted time. Nationally, \\n88 percent of these contracts convert to debt—a debt where you are charged \\na rip-off interest rate of 24 to 38 percent, and they back-charge you to the \\ndate of purchase. Please don’t tell me you are the one who is actually going \\nto pay it off. A $1,000 stereo (don’t forget, you didn’t get a discount) will \\nnot make you rich in ninety days. But $1,000 left in a savings account at \\n3 percent annual interest will earn you $7.50 in ninety days.

She and her husband purchased \\na big-screen TV at a nationally known electronics store. This couple paid \\noff the big screen slightly early to be sure they would not be tricked into \\nthe interest being back-charged. No such luck. They had declined the dis\\xad\\nability and life insurance (a charge of $174), but apparently the salesperson \\nhad fraudulently initialed the contract in that area, something that happens \\nmore frequently than you think. So although our brilliant couple thought \\nthey had paid off the TV, they still had a balance and were charged inter\\xad\\nest back through the entire deal. They were fighting it, but it would take \\nhiring a handwriting expert and going to court with an attorney to avoid \\npaying a bill under $1,000, even though they did not owe it.

The Federal Reserve notes \\nthat the average car payment is $495 over sixty-four months. Most \\npeople get a car payment and keep it throughout their lives.

If you have a tax write-off of $5,000, you \\ndon’t pay taxes on that money.

That means they are professional enough \\nto process the details of your life instead of using only a FICO score (lending \\nfor dummies). It’s getting harder to find a lender who will go to the trouble \\nof actually getting to know you, but they’re out there. If one bank tells you \\nthey can’t do it, keep looking.

If you stay in debt longer, you pay the \\nlender more, which is why they are in the business of debt consolidation. \\nThe answer is not the interest rate; the answer is a Total Money Makeover.\\nMYTH: Borrowing more than my home’s value is wise because I’ll \\nrestructure my debt.\\nTRUTH: You are stuck in the house, which is really dumb.\\nOn today’s radio show I took a call from a desperate man facing bank\\xad\\nruptcy. He had borrowed $42,000 on a second mortgage, a home equity \\nloan. Dan’s existing balance on his first mortgage was $110,000, making \\nhis total new mortgage debt $152,000. Dan’s home was worth $125,000, \\nso he owed $27,000 more on his home than it was worth. He lost his job \\ntwo months ago and luckily has just found a job in another state, but he \\ncan’t sell his home. He had the same job for sixteen years and thought he \\nhad security, but now, just a few months later, he is “in the soup.”\\nMy suggestion to Dan was that he call the second mortgage rip-off \\nlender and get an acknowledgment of the truth, that there really isn’t any \\ncollateral for the loan. They wouldn’t foreclose in a hundred years, but they \\nwill sue him when the first mortgage company forecloses. So, after asking \\nthe second lender to release the lien for whatever proceeds above the first \\nmortgage come from a sale, Dan will sign a note and make payments on \\nthe rest. Dan will have payments for years to come on a second mortgage \\nfor a home he no longer owns, but like most folks, his second mortgage was'),\n",

Why do people stay in jobs they hate, \\nseeking false security? The Total Money Makeover mentality is to live like \\nno one else so later we can live like no one else. A price has to be paid, and \\nthere are no shortcuts. While no one goes looking for needless pain, risk, \\nor sacrifice, when something sounds too good to be true, it is. The myths \\nin this chapter are rooted in two basic problems. First is risk denial, think\\xad\\ning total safety is possible and likely. Second is easy wealth, or looking for \\nthe magic key to open the treasure chest.\\nRisk Denial\\nRisk denial takes several forms in the world of money.

Living right financially is the same \\nway—it is not complicated; it may be difficult, but it is not complicated.\\nMyth vs. Truth\\nIn addition to Debt Myths, we must dispel several other Money Myths as part \\nof your Total Money Makeover.

In other words, by pre\\xad\\npaying, you avoid the price increases, and that is your return. Prepaying items \\nis like investing at the item’s inflation rate. For example, prepaying college \\ntuition will save you the amount tuition goes up between the time you lock \\nin and the time your child begins his college education. The average infla\\xad\\ntion rate for tuition nationally is about 8 percent, so prepaying tuition is like \\ninvesting money at 8 percent. That is not bad, but mutual funds will average \\nabout 12 percent over a long period of time, and you can save for college tax-\\nFREE.

If you take \\nthe thoughtful step backward to get on solid ground instead of looking at \\nthe false allure of the quick fix that bankruptcy seems to offer, you will \\nwin more quickly and easily.

We cover insurance in detail at \\nFinancial Peace University and in other books, but you must have insur\\xad\\nance in some basic categories as part of a Total Money Makeover:\\n• Auto and Homeowner Insurance—Choose higher deductibles in \\norder to save on premiums. With high liability limits, these are the \\nbest buys in the insurance world.\\n• Life Insurance—Purchase twenty-year level term insurance equal \\nto about ten times your income. Term insurance is cheap and the \\nonly way to go; never use life insurance as a place to save money.\\n• Long-Term Disability—If you are thirty-two years old, you are \\ntwelve times more likely to become disabled than to die by age \\nsixty-five. The best place to buy disability insurance is through \\nwork at a fraction of the cost. You can usually get coverage that \\nequals from 50 to 70 percent of your income.\\n• Health Insurance—The number one cause of bankruptcy today \\nis medical bills; number two is credit cards. One way to control \\ncosts is to look for large deductibles to lower your premium. The \\nHSA (Health Savings Account) is a great way to save on premiums. \\nThe high deductible creates a much lower premium, and this \\nplan allows you to save for medical expenses in a tax-free savings \\naccount.\\n• Long-Term Care Insurance—If you are over sixty, buy Long-Term \\nCare insurance to cover in-home care or nursing home care. The \\naverage nursing home stay costs $40,000 per year, which will \\ncrack and scramble a nest egg in a heartbeat. Dad in the nursing \\nhome can use up Mom’s $250,000 savings in just a few short \\nyears. Make your parents get it.'),\n",

In a culture that worships knowledge, to say \\nignorance about money is an issue makes some people defensive. Don’t \\nbe defensive. Ignorance is not lack of intelligence; it is lack of know-how. \\nI have seen many newborn babies of friends, relatives, church members, \\nand team members. I have never seen a baby who was born ready to be \\nwealthy. Never do the friends and relatives gather around the window of \\nthe nursery and exclaim, “Oh, look! She is a born financial genius!”\\nNo one is born with the knowledge of how to drive a car. We are taught \\nthe skill (although some of us don’t seem to have learned). No one is born \\nwith the knowledge of how to read and write; we are taught how. None of \\nthese are innate skills; all must be taught. Likewise, no one is born with \\nthe knowledge of how to handle money, but we AREN’T taught that!\\nAt the coffeepot one day, one of my leaders said, “We need to get \\nthis Total Money Makeover process taught in college.” Before she could \\ngraduate from a small Christian college, she was required to take a class \\non how to interview and hunt for a job. She said the class wasn’t very \\nhard academically, but its practical implications made it one of the most \\nvaluable classes she took in college. We go to school to learn to earn; we \\nearn and then have no idea what to do with the money. According to the \\nCensus Bureau, the average family in America makes right at $50,000. \\nEven if they never get a raise, the average family will make over $2 million \\nin a working lifetime! And we teach NOTHING about how to manage \\nthis money in most high schools and colleges. We graduate from school, \\ngo out into the world, and get a financial master’s degree in D.U.M.B.\\nDo we make a mess of our finances because we aren’t intelligent? \\nNo. If you put someone who has never driven a car, has never seen a car,'),\n",

If you want to be rich, you should study the habits and value systems \\nof the rich.

He found \\nthe typical millionaire lives in a middle-class home, drives a two-year-old \\nor older paid-for car, and buys blue jeans at Wal-Mart. In short, Stanley \\nfound that the typical millionaire found infinitely more motivation from \\nthe goal of financial security than from what friends and family thought. \\nThe need for approval and respect from others based on what they owned \\nwas virtually nonexistent.\\nIf we look at Stanley’s findings and hold those up against Ken and \\nBarbie’s life plan, we find Ken and Barbie to be lost, off course, and \\nclueless. Ken and Barbie are in our office all the time for financial coun\\xad\\nseling. Last year they were here, and their names were Bob and Sara. \\nBob and Sara make $93,000 per year and have for the last seven years. \\nWhat do they have to show for it? A $400,000 home that they still owe \\n$390,000 on, including a home equity loan used to furnish it. They have \\ntwo $30,000 fleeced cars and $52,000 in credit-card debt, but they have \\ntraveled well and dressed in high fashion. The $25,000 left on a student \\nloan from college ten years ago is still outstanding because they have no \\nmoney. On the positive side, they have $2,000 in savings and $18,000 \\nin their 401(k). These people have a negative net worth, but they really \\nlook good. Bob’s mom is very impressed, and Sara’s brother frequently \\nstops by to ask for money because they are “obviously doing well.” They \\npresent the perfect picture of the American dream that has turned into a \\nnightmare.

If your body were in the same condition that Bob \\nand Sara’s money is in, everyone would think, Five hundred pounds is just \\ntoo fat. Your problem would be apparent to family, friends, strangers, and \\neven you.

Some of you \\nare grinning as if this is no big deal. It was a huge deal in Sara’s family! \\nGift giving was a tradition! Her mother and two of her sisters-in-law were \\nfurious.

We had become wealthy again, and I decided to get a dif\\xad\\nferent car. I’m always looking for a one- or two-year-old car, I’m always \\npaying cash, and I’m always looking for a deal, not really caring what \\ncar it is. I was kind of looking for a Mercedes or a Lexus, but I was \\nreally looking for a steal. A friend in the car business called me with \\na deal—on a Jaguar. So all those years and tears later, when it was no \\nlonger the driving force of my approval rating, God allowed a Jaguar \\nback into my life. He returned what the locusts had eaten, but He only \\ndid so when it was not my idol.

We are in better shape now for mountain climbing, and there are no \\nblind spots. We are ready to climb. The goal is far off, but we can see it \\nclearly now.

Most of us make the first climb wearing a hat of Ignorance, \\nand while it will slow the climb, ignorance will not keep anyone from the \\ntop when mixed with some humility. This mountain is doable, but not \\nif you are still bogged down on the obstacle course.

If you don’t collapse the first day, wait forty-eight hours \\nfor the muscle groups to lock up and the cardio to go crazy, and you will \\nbe bingeing on food shortly thereafter. When I went on a quest for a better \\nbody and better health a few years ago, my wise trainer didn’t try to kill \\nme the first day. Not even by the second week were we pushing the enve\\xad\\nlope, because he knew I had to create some muscle tone before we could \\nhit hard workouts. We walked before we ran.

Each of these \\nsteps is part of the proven plan to financial fitness I promised you. They build \\non one another; therefore, if done out of order, they do not work. Think of a \\n350-pound person beginning marathon training with a quick ten-mile run. \\nThe results of not building up to that run could be total frustration at best \\nand a heart attack at worst.

You will be tempted to short-\\ncircuit the process because you are more concerned about one certain \\narea of your money, but don’t do it. These steps are the proven plan \\nto financial fitness, and they are in the right order for everyone. For \\nexample, if you are fifty-five with no retirement, you may be tempted \\nto jump to Step Four (Invest 15 Percent of Your Income in Retirement), \\nbecause you are scared about not being able to retire with dignity. The \\nparadox is that by shortcutting the process, you are much more likely to \\nfail at retiring with dignity. Failure could also occur when you cash out \\nyour newly formed retirement plan to cover the inevitable emergency. If \\nyou have kids heading toward college, you may be panicking about sav\\xad\\ning for college, which is covered in Baby Step Five, but don’t do it out of \\norder. I will address the problems you’ll run into at each stage if you get \\nthings out of order, because I have seen most of them. Focus exclusively \\non the Baby Step you are on, even though it seems to be a temporary \\ndetriment to other areas of money.

The typical American with a $50,000 annual \\nincome would normally have an $850 house payment and a $495 car pay\\xad\\nment, with an additional $180 payment on the second car. Then there is \\na $165 student-loan payment; and the average credit-card debt is about \\n$12,000, making those monthly payments around $185 per month. Also, \\nthis typical household will have other miscellaneous debt on things like \\nfurniture, stereos, or personal loans on which they pay an additional $120. \\nAll these payments total $1,995 per month. If this family were to invest \\nthat instead of sending it to the creditors, they would be cash mutual-fund \\nmillionaires in just fifteen years! (After fifteen years, it gets really excit\\xad\\ning. They’ll have $2 million in five more years, $3 million in three more \\nyears, $4 million in two and a half more years, and $5.5 million in two \\nmore years. So they will have $5.5 million after twenty-eight years.) Keep \\nin mind, this is with an average income, which means many of you make \\nmore than this! If you are thinking that you don’t have that many payments \\nso your math won’t work, you missed the point. If you make $50,000 and \\nhave fewer payments, you have a head start, since you already have more \\ncontrol of your income than most people.\\nWith a take-home pay of $3,350, could you invest $1,995 if you had \\nno payments? All you have to pay for are utilities, food, clothes, insurance, \\nand other miscellaneous expenses. That would be tight, but doable. If you \\ndo that for just fifteen years, you will have a pinnacle experience. I will \\nexplain that later.\\nMany of you reading this are convinced that you could become wealthy \\nif you could get out of debt.

Remember what my pastor said: “It isn’t complicated, but it is \\ndifficult.” We have discussed that personal finance is 80 percent behavior \\nand 20 percent head knowledge. The Debt Snowball is designed the way \\nit is because we are more concerned with modifying behavior than cor\\xad\\nrect mathematics. (You’ll see what I mean shortly.) Being a certified nerd, \\nI always used to start with making the math work. I have learned that the \\nmath does need to work, but sometimes motivation is more important than \\nmath.

You can’t get ready, fire, and then aim with money, \\nand you can’t try to do six things at the same time. You are trying to get \\nout of debt. Period. You will have to focus with great intensity to do it.\\nProverbs 6:1 and 5 (loosely Dave-paraphrased) says, “If you have \\nsigned surety, my son, [surety is Bible talk for debt]\\xa0 .\\xa0 .\\xa0 . deliver your\\xad\\nself like the bird from the hand of the fowler and the gazelle from the \\nhand of the hunter.” I remember reading that Bible verse in my daily Bible \\nstudy one day and thinking what a cute little animal metaphor it was \\nfor getting out of debt. Then one day later that week I was surfing chan\\xad\\nnels and hit the Discovery Channel. I noticed they were filming gazelles. \\nThe gazelles were peacefully gazelling around. Of course, you know the \\nDiscovery Channel wasn’t there just for the gazelles. The next camera shot \\nwas of Mr. Cheetah sneaking up in the bushes looking for lunch in all the \\nright places. Suddenly, one of the gazelles got a whiff of Mr. Cheetah and \\nbecame very aware of his plan. The other gazelles noticed the alarm and \\nsoon also were on edge. They couldn’t yet see the cheetah, so out of fear \\nof running at him, they froze until he played his cards.\\nRealizing he had been discovered, Mr. Cheetah decided to give it his best \\nshot and leaped from the bushes. The gazelles all yelled, “Cheetah!” Well, \\nnot really, but they did run like crazy in fourteen different directions. The \\nDiscovery Channel that day reminded viewers that the cheetah is the fastest \\nmammal on dry land; he can go from zero to forty-five miles per hour in \\nfour leaps. The show also proved that because the gazelle will outmaneuver \\nthe cheetah instead of outrunning him, the cheetah will tire quickly. As a \\nmatter of fact, the cheetah only gets his gazelle burger for lunch in one out \\nof nineteen chases. The gazelle’s primary hunter is the fastest mammal on \\ndry ground, yet the gazelle wins almost every time. Likewise, the way out \\nof debt is to outmaneuver the enemy and run for your life.'),\n",

There is no push to get the Snowball \\nrolling. Let me offer another image to help you better understand this \\nproblem and the solution. My great-great-grandfather ran a timber opera\\xad\\ntion in the hills of Kentucky and West Virginia. In that bygone era, after \\ncutting the timber, they would put the logs into the river to float them \\ndownstream to the sawmill. The logs would build up at a bend in the \\nriver, and a traffic jam of wood occurred. This would continue as long as \\nthe jammed-up area stopped the progress of the other logs. Sometimes the \\nloggers could break the jam loose by pushing the logs. Other times they \\nwould have to get radical before a real mess occurred.\\nWhen it got bad, they would break the logjam by throwing dynamite \\ninto the middle of the logs that were blocking the progress. As you can \\nimagine, this created a dramatic effect. When the dynamite blew, logs and \\npieces of logs would fly into the air. After working so hard to cut the trees, \\nsome of them were a total loss. They had to blow up some of the timber to \\nget the rest of the crop to market. That’s the sacrifice the situation required. \\nSometimes that is what you have to do with the stopped-up budget. You \\nhave to dynamite it. You have to get radical to get the money flowing again.\\nOne way to do that is to sell something. You could sell lots of little \\nstuff at a garage sale, sell a seldom-used item on the Internet, or sell a \\nprecious item through the classifieds. Get gazelle-intense and sell so much \\nstuff that the kids are afraid they are next. Sell things that make your \\nbroke friends question your sanity. If your budget is stopped-up and your \\nDebt Snowball won’t roll on its own, you are going to have to get radical.\\nIn watching heroes across the nation get out of debt with gazelle inten\\xad\\nsity, believe me, I have seen them sell things. One lady sold 350 goldfish \\nfrom her pond for a dollar apiece. Men have sold their Harleys, boats, \\nknife collections, or baseball cards. Ladies have sold precious things like \\nnonfamily antiques (keep the heirlooms because you can’t get them back) \\nor a personal car they thought was necessary to life on the planet. I don’t \\nrecommend selling your home unless you have payments above 45 per\\xad\\ncent of your monthly take-home pay. Usually, the home isn’t the problem.'),\n",

The Debt \\nSnowball, or stop and go back to Baby Step One (save $1,000)? Penny needs \\nto put the Debt Snowball temporarily on hold. She will continue to make \\nminimum payments and go back to the first step until she gets back up to \\n$1,000 in her emergency fund. If she doesn’t, soon she will have nothing in \\nsavings, and when the alternator on the car goes out, she will reopen some \\ncredit-card account. The same applies to you. If you use the emergency fund, \\nreturn to Baby Step One until you have re-funded your beginner emergency \\nfund; then move right back to your Debt Snowball, Baby Step Two.\\nSecond Mortgages, Business Debt, and \\nRental Property Mortgages\\nBecause of debt-consolidation loans and other mistakes, many people \\nhave a home equity loan or some kind of large second mortgage. What \\nshould be done with this loan? Is it put in the Debt Snowball, or just called \\na mortgage and not dealt with at this step? It will be paid off; it is just a \\nmatter of at which step. Generally speaking, if your second mortgage is \\nmore than 50 percent of your gross annual income, you should not put \\nit in the Debt Snowball. We will get to it later. If you make $40,000 per \\nyear and have a $15,000 second mortgage, you should put it in the Debt \\nSnowball. Let’s just take care of it now. But if you have a $35,000 second \\nmortgage and make $40,000, you will get to it in another step. By the way, \\nyou should consider refinancing your first and second mortgages together \\nif you can lower both interest rates. Then put the total on a fifteen-year'),\n",

This \\nfund is for actual protection and for peace of mind, so the spouse who \\nwants this fund to be higher wins.\\nWe use three to six months of expenses instead of three to six months \\nof income because the fund is to cover expenses, not replace income. If \\nyou become ill or lose a job, you need to keep the lights on and food on \\nthe table until things turn around, but you might stop investing, and you’ll \\ndefinitely stop spending budgeted “blow money” until the rain clears. Of \\ncourse, when you are just starting your Total Money Makeover, your \\nexpenses might equal your income.

The very thought of using $5,000 of that savings to pay \\nthe credit cards partially off is very hard. That $6,000 emergency fund is \\nyour security blanket, and fear rises up deep inside when someone like me \\nmentions that you should use that money to Snowball your debt.

Of course, I \\ndidn’t make that suggestion. I think it would be a bad move for them to \\nuse $9,000 in this situation. The reason I’m against using the savings as \\nsuggested is that hubby isn’t onboard. He wants to do part of the plan \\nand keep his stupid truck. There are two reasons not to use the emergency \\nfund in Sherry’s case. First, hubby has not had a Total Money Makeover \\nin his heart, and they will never make it out of debt under any strategy \\nuntil he does. Second, do the math: on a $43,000 income, they will be in \\ndebt and have only a super-small emergency fund for years if they keep the \\ntruck. This would be like my wife saying she wants me to lose weight and \\nthen baking homemade chocolate-chip cookies every night. She would be \\nsaying one thing and doing another.\\nI don’t suggest you clean out your savings if everyone isn’t having a \\nTotal Money Makeover. I also don’t suggest you clean out your savings if \\nyou are planning to be in Baby Step Two (Start the Debt Snowball) for five \\nyears. However, few of you will be in Step Two very long if you go gazelle-\\nintense and follow this plan to the letter. If your family is exposed to the \\nelements, with only $1,000 standing between you and life for eighteen to \\ntwenty months, that is fine. In that case, you should use your savings to \\nbecome debt-free or accelerate the Snowball.\\nI know that even if everyone is onboard, gazelle-intense, and there is a \\nplan, my suggestion still scares some of you.

At the start, though, you’ll be like we \\nwere—everything will be an emergency. To show you what I mean, consider \\ntwo different stories of people at two different places in the Baby Steps.\\nKim was twenty-three, single, on her own, and at a job making $27,000 \\nper year. She had recently started her Total Money Makeover. She was \\nbehind on credit cards, not on a budget, and barely making her rent because \\nher spending was out of control. She let her car insurance drop because she \\n“couldn’t afford it.” She did her first budget and two days later was in a \\ncar wreck. Since it wasn’t bad, the damage to the other guy’s car was only \\nabout $550. As Kim looked at me through panicked tears, that $550 might \\nas well have been $55,000. She hadn’t even started Baby Step One. She was \\ntrying to get current, and now she had one more hurdle to clear before she \\neven started. This was a huge emergency.\\nSeven years ago George and Sally were in the same place. They were \\nbroke with new babies, and George’s career was sputtering. George and \\nSally fought and scraped through a Total Money Makeover. Today they are \\ndebt-free, even their $85,000 home. They have a $12,000 emergency fund, \\nretirement in Roth IRAs, and even the kids’ college is funded. George has \\ngrown personally, his career has blossomed, and he now makes $75,000 \\nper year while Sally stays home with the kids. One day a piece of trash \\nflew out of the back of George’s pickup and hit a car behind him on the \\ninterstate. The damage was about $550.\\nI think you can see that George and Sally probably adjusted one \\nmonth’s budget and paid the repairs, while Kim dealt with her wreck for'),\n",

As you have better health \\ninsurance, disability insurance, more room in your budget, and better cars, \\nyou will have fewer things that qualify as emergency-fund emergencies.\\nWhat used to be a huge, life-altering event will become a mere incon\\xad\\nvenience. When you are debt-free and aggressively investing to become \\nwealthy, taking a few months off from investing will put a new engine in a \\ncar. When I say the emergency fund is Murphy-repellent, that is only par\\xad\\ntially correct. The reality is that Murphy doesn’t visit as much, but when \\nhe does, we hardly notice his presence. When Sharon and I were broke, \\nour heating-and-air system quit, and the repair cost $580. It was a huge, \\nhairy deal.

If you hate your career path, \\nchange it. You should do something with your life that lights your fire and \\nlets you use your gifts. Retirement in America has come to mean “save \\nenough money so I can quit the job I hate.” That is a bad life plan.\\nHarold Fisher was one hundred years old. He worked five days a week \\nat the architectural firm he founded. Mr. Fisher didn’t work because he \\nneeded money, not by a long shot. He worked because he found joy in what \\nhe did. He was a designer of churches. His favorite saying was, “People \\nwho retire early, die early.” “If I retired, what would I do?” he asked. \\nHarold Fisher was financially secure and able to do what he wanted, and \\nthat defines retirement the Total Money Makeover way.\\nWhen I speak of retirement, I think of security. Security means choices. \\n(That’s why I think retirement means that work is an option.) You can \\nchoose to write a book, to design churches, or to spend time with your \\ngrandkids. You need to reach the point where your money works harder \\nthan you do. A Total Money Makeover retirement plan means investing \\nwith the goal of security. You already possess the ability to quit your \\njob, and if you don’t like your work, you should consider doing that. If \\nnot today, develop a five-year game plan for transitioning into what God \\ndesigned you to do; however, don’t wait till you’re sixty-five to do what \\nyou love.'),\n",

Baby Step Four is time to get really serious about \\nyour wealth building. Remember, when you reach this step you don’t have \\nany payments but a house payment, and you have three to six months’ \\nworth of expenses in savings, which is thousands of dollars. With only one \\npayment, it should be easy to invest heavily. Even with a below-average \\nincome, you can ensure your golden years will have dignity. Before this \\nstep, you have ceased or have never started investing, and now you have to \\nreally pour on the coals.\\nGazelle intensity in the previous steps has allowed you to be able to \\nfocus on growing a sizable nest egg. The tens of thousands of people \\nwe have met have helped me develop the 15 percent rule. The rule is \\nsimple: Invest 15 percent of before-tax gross income annually toward \\nretirement. Why not more? You need some of your income left to do \\nthe next two steps: college saving and paying off your home early. Why \\nnot less? Some people want to invest less or none so they can get a child \\nthrough school or pay off the home superfast. I don’t recommend that \\nbecause those kids’ college degrees won’t feed you at retirement. I don’t \\nrecommend paying off the house first because I have counseled too many \\nseventy-five-year-olds with a paid-for house and no money. They end \\nup selling the family home or mortgaging it to eat. Bad plan. You need \\nsome retirement investing at this stage before saving for college and the \\nmortgage payoff. Plus, by getting started now, the magic of compound \\ninterest will work for you.\\nWhen calculating your 15 percent, don’t include company matches \\nin your plan. Invest 15 percent of your gross income. If your company \\nmatches some or part of your contribution, you can consider it gravy. \\nRemember, this is a rule of thumb, so if you cheat down to 12 percent or \\nup to 17 percent, that is not a huge problem, but understand the dangers \\nof straying far from 15 percent. If you underinvest, you will one day be \\nbuying that classic cookbook 72 Ways to Prepare Alpo and Love It. If you \\noverinvest, you will keep your home mortgage too long, which will hold \\nback the wealth-building power of your Total Money Makeover.'),\n",

The stock market has averaged just below a 12 percent return on \\ninvestment throughout its history. Growth-stock mutual funds are what I \\nrecommend investing in for the long term. Growth-stock mutual funds are \\nlousy short-term investments because they go up and down in value, but \\nthey are excellent long-term investments when leaving the money longer \\nthan five years. One hundred percent of the fifteen-year periods in the stock \\nmarket’s history have made money. The Total Money Makeover is not an \\ninvestment textbook, so if you need more detailed information, check out \\nour class, Financial Peace University, or my first book, Financial Peace. \\nMy personal retirement funds and my kids’ college funds are invested the \\nway I teach in The Total Money Makeover.\\nHere’s a Reader’s Digest version of my approach. I select mutual funds \\nthat have had a good track record of winning for more than five years, \\npreferably for more than ten years.

Always start where you have a match. When your \\ncompany will give you free money, take it. If your 401(k) matches the first \\n3 percent, the 3 percent you put in will be the first 3 percent of your 15 \\npercent invested. If you don’t have a match, or after you have invested \\nthrough the match, you should next fund Roth IRAs.\\nThe Roth IRA will allow you to invest up to $5,000 per year, per \\nperson. There are some limitations as to income and situation, but most \\npeople can invest in a Roth IRA. The Roth grows tax-FREE. If you invest \\n$3,000 per year from age thirty-five to age sixty-five, and your mutual \\nfunds average 12 percent, you will have $873,000 tax-FREE at age sixty-\\nfive. You have invested only $90,000 (30 years x 3,000); the rest is growth, \\nand you pay no taxes. The Roth IRA is a very important tool in virtually \\nanyone’s Total Money Makeover.\\nStart with any match you can get, and then fully fund Roth IRAs. \\nBe sure the total you are putting in is 15 percent of your total household \\ngross income. If not, go back to 401(k)s, 403(b)s, 457s, or SEPPs (for the \\nself-employed), and invest enough so that the total invested is 15 percent \\nof your gross annual pay.'),\n",

Hear me on this: college is great, \\nbut don’t expect too much from that degree. What if we were to admit \\nthat, in most cases, college can only teach knowledge? If we did, we’d \\nsee that failure and heartache are guaranteed—if we expect a college \\ndegree by itself to deliver life’s treasures. Only if you mix knowledge with \\nattitude, character, perseverance, vision, diligence, and extreme levels of \\nwork will your college degree produce for you.

I have been a millionaire starting with nothing \\ntwo times before I was forty, and I attribute 15 percent of that to college \\nknowledge and 0 percent to the degree. The book Emotional Intelligence \\nreported a similar finding. In studying successful people, the author dis\\xad\\ncovered that 15 percent of success could be attributed to training and \\neducation, while 85 percent was attributed to attitude, perseverance, dili\\xad\\ngence, and vision.

To be financially \\nsuccessful, you’ve got to quit caring about what other people think. If you can really \\nget that before you go to college, then you’re making a giant step in the right direction.\\nDave’s Rules for College\\nDo some research on the cost of attending college. Find out what your \\nold college costs today. Find out what the big state school in your area \\ncosts. Find out what the smaller state school in your neighborhood costs. \\nFind out what the private, smaller, more intimate college costs. Compare \\nthem. In some areas of study and in a very few careers, where you gradu\\xad\\nate from will matter, but in most it won’t. Pedigree means less and less in \\nour work culture today. How can you justify going into debt $75,000 for \\na degree when you could have gone to a state school and paid for it out of \\nyour pocket debt-free? You can’t. If you have the $75,000 extra cash or a \\nfree-ride scholarship and want to go to that private school debt-free, by all \\nmeans, do it. Otherwise, reconsider.\\nThe first rule of college (whether for you or for your children) is: pay \\ncash. The second rule is: if you have the cash or the scholarship, go. A \\ncouple of years ago I met with the dean of the college of business from \\nthe university where I graduated. At that time, the average college student \\ngraduated with about $15,000 in student-loan debt after spending three \\nof four years in an apartment, not the dorm, and eating off-campus, not \\non the meal plan. The average student paid $5,000 more per year to live \\nand eat off-campus than to live in the dorm and eat cafeteria food. The \\nstudent loans that they “had to have” or they wouldn’t be able to go to \\ncollege weren’t for college at all. The student loans, on average, paid for an'),\n",

Inflation of goods and \\nservices averages about 4 percent per year, while tuition inflation averages \\nabout 8 percent per year. When you save for college, you have to make at \\nleast 8 percent per year to keep up with the increases. Baby life insurance, \\nlike Gerber or other Whole Life for babies to save for college, is a joke, \\naveraging less than a 2 percent return. Savings bonds won’t work either \\n(sorry, Grandma!) because they average about 5 percent. Most states now \\noffer prepaid college tuition. We discussed that in chapter 4 on Money \\nMyths, but remember that when you prepay anything, you simply break \\neven with inflation on that item. If tuition goes up 8 percent a year and \\nyou prepay it, you make 8 percent on your money. That is not too bad, but \\nkeep in mind that a decent growth-stock mutual fund will average over 12 \\npercent when invested long term. Of course, there are worse things than \\nprepaid tuition. USA Today reports that 37 percent of the few who actu\\xad\\nally save for college do so in a simple savings account yielding less than 3 \\npercent. That won’t get it done. I know, something’s better than nothing. \\nBut I like another adage better in this case: if something’s worth doing, it’s \\nworth doing right.

The next type is a “fixed \\nportfolio” plan, which sets a fixed percentage of your investment in a group \\nof mutual funds and locks you in until you need the money.

No payments. How would it feel to have \\nno payments? I have said it before, and I will repeat myself until you \\nhear me: if you invested what you pay in monthly payments, you’d be \\na debt-free millionaire before long. Your largest wealth-building tool is \\nyour income; you have read that over and over. Now you get to see the \\npossibilities unfold. You have trained, conditioned, and eaten right to run \\nthis marathon, so don’t quit on the eighteenth mile! Every dollar in your \\nbudget that you can find above living, retirement, and college should be \\nused to make extra payments on your home. Attack that home mortgage \\nwith gazelle intensity.\\nMy family has a fabulous dog, a Chinese pug, a dog like Frank in the \\nMen in Black movies. Her name is Heaven, and when we talk to her, she \\ncocks her little round head sideways in a questioning look as if we have \\nlost our minds. If you heard the way we talk to the dog, you might think \\nwe really had lost our minds. We have all seen the cocked-sideways look \\ncoming at us when we have said something weird, something against \\nthe culture. When I say, “Pay off the mortgage,” some of you look at \\nthis book as if I had told you to build wings and fly to the moon.\\nAnytime I speak about paying off mortgages, people give me that spe\\xad\\ncial look. They think I’m crazy for two reasons. One, most people have \\nlost their hope, and they don’t really believe there is any chance for them. \\nTwo, most people believe all the mortgage myths that have been spread. \\nYes, we must dispel a few more myths. There are two really big “reasons” \\nthat keep seemingly intelligent people (like me for years) from paying off \\nmortgages, so we will start with those.'),\n",

Sadly, some “financial plan\\xad\\nners” have told Americans to borrow on their homes at around 8 percent \\nto invest in good growth-stock mutual funds averaging 12 percent because \\nyou make an easy 4 percent spread.\\nMutual funds are awesome investments, and as I have said, I personally \\nhave tons of money invested in good growth-stock mutual funds. Also, the \\nstock market has averaged around 12 percent from the beginning. Some \\nyears are great and some are lousy, and we have had both in the last ten \\nyears, but the long-term average is around 12 percent. So I buy and recom\\xad\\nmend mutual funds.\\nThe problem with this myth is that the assumptions used to get to that \\n4 percent spread or profit on investing are wrong. Mythsayers, and I have \\nbeen one, are very naïve in how they approach investing.\\nLet’s look at borrowing $100,000 on your home to invest. If you \\nborrowed at 8 percent, you would pay $8,000 in interest, and if you \\ninvested the $100,000 you borrowed on your home and made 12 percent, \\nyou would make $12,000 in return, netting you $4,000. Or would you? \\nWhere I live, if you make $12,000 on an investment, you will pay taxes. If \\nyou are in a 30 percent bracket, you will pay $3,600 in taxes at ordinary'),\n",

So you will not \\nnet $4,000, but instead $400 to $1,600. But we aren’t through yet.\\nIf I own the home next to you and have no debt, and you (because of \\nyour investment adviser guy) borrowed $100,000 on your home, who has \\ntaken more risk? When the economy moves south, when there is war or \\nrumors of war, when you get sick or have a car wreck or are downsized, \\nyou will run into major problems with a $100,000 mortgage that I will \\nnever have. So debt causes risk to increase.\\nI can prove to you that risk increases. With the drop in real estate \\nvalues and the slowing market in the 2008–09 recession, many people \\nlost their homes to foreclosure. I have done in-depth, detailed research \\nand have found that 100 percent of the foreclosed homes had a mortgage. \\nHa! Sadly, some of the people who lost their homes had a naïve financial \\nplanner who left risk out of his formula and suggested they “harvest” their \\nequity. Like I said earlier, “When the tide goes out, you can tell who was \\nskinny-dipping.”\\nSince debt causes increased risk, we must mathematically factor in \\na reduction in return if we are sophisticated investors. If you can make \\n12 percent on a mutual fund, and I try to get you to invest in a bet on \\nthe roulette wheel, which will return you 500 percent, you would auto\\xad\\nmatically say the two don’t compare. Why? Risk. Common sense tells \\nyou not to compare mutual funds and roulette wheel returns without \\nadjusting the returns for risk. Common sense tells you to discount the \\n500 percent upside of the roulette wheel because of risk. After discount\\xad\\ning the roulette wheel for risk, you would rather have the mutual fund. \\nGood choice.\\nActually, this is done in academia as well. There is a statistical measure \\nof risk called a beta. A big beta means a big risk. Graduate-level financial \\npeople who are taught mathematical formulas to make risky investments \\ncompare apples to apples with safer investments after adjustment for risk. \\nWe just never apply that formula to a debt-free home versus a mortgaged \\nand invested home, which is very naïve. The technical formula is great for'),\n",

What happened? I was there in the middle of that disaster of \\nan economy when fixed-rate mortgages went as high as 17 percent and the \\nreal estate world froze. Lenders paid out 12 percent on CDs but had money \\nloaned out at 7 percent on hundreds of millions of dollars in mortgages. They \\nwere losing money, and lenders don’t like to lose money. So the Adjustable \\nRate Mortgage was born, in which your interest rate goes up when the pre\\xad\\nvailing market interest rates go up. The ARM was born to transfer the risk \\nof higher interest rates to you, the consumer. In the last several years, home \\nmortgage rates have been at a thirty-year low.

IF YOU WILL LIVE LIKE NO ONE ELSE, LATER YOU CAN LIVE l\\nAN\\nFirst, let me tell you that mortgage debt is the only kind of debt I don’t \\nyell about. I want you to pay off your home as a part of your Total Money \\nMakeover, and, for all the reasons stated in the previous pages, you have to \\nbe very careful. When asked about mortgages, I tell everyone never to take \\nmore than a fifteen-year fixed-rate loan, and never have a payment of over \\n25 percent of your take-home pay. That is the most you should ever borrow.\\nI don’t borrow money—ever. Luke called me from Cleveland to tell me \\nthat some of our listeners and readers are doing what Sharon and I have \\ndone, “The 100-Percent-Down Plan.” Pay cash. Most people don’t think \\nthat can be done. Luke did it.\\nLuke made really good money. His income at twenty-three years old \\nwas $50,000, and he married a young lady making $30,000. His grand\\xad\\nfather had preached to him never to borrow money. So Luke and his \\nnew bride lived in a very small apartment over a rich lady’s garage. They \\npaid only $250 a month for it. They lived on nothing, did nothing that \\ncost money, and they saved. Man, did they save! Making $80,000 in the \\nhousehold, they saved $50,000 a year for three years and paid cash for a \\n$150,000 home. They closed on the home on Luke’s wife’s twenty-sixth \\nbirthday. They lived like no one else, and now they are living like no \\none else. If you make $80,000 per year and don’t have any payments, \\nyou can become very wealthy very quickly. Keep in mind, though, that \\nLuke’s friends and relatives thought he should be committed. They made \\nfun of his cars, his lifestyle, and his dream. Only his bride and his grand\\xad\\nfather believed in his dream. Who cares what the broke people think?\\nYou may not make $80,000 per year, but you may not need a $150,000 \\nhome as your starter either. You may not make $80,000 per year, so \\nyour dream might take five years instead of three, like Luke’s. Ask any \\neighty-year-old if five years of sacrifice is worth it to change your finan\\xad\\ncial destiny for the rest of your life! Ask any eighty-year-old if five years \\nof sacrifice is worth it to have the satisfaction of knowing you changed \\nyour family tree. Paying cash for a home is possible, very possible. What’s \\nhard to find is people willing to pay the price in sacrificed lifestyle.'),\n",

Every time the mort\\xad\\ngage or rent was due, the checkbook \\ngot tighter and tighter. I was trying to \\nfinish college, and he had a lot of unpaid debt from his previous mar\\xad\\nriage. I had one credit card that I found myself using for emergencies (car \\nrepairs, etc.). I didn’t believe in carrying a balance on it, but our debt was \\nfairly substantial when we got married.\\nShortly into our marriage, we began our Total Money Makeover. \\nDoug listened to the radio show every day during his thirty-minute com\\xad\\nmute to work and was convinced of the financial peace we could have in \\nour future by simply following the Baby Steps. I decided to get onboard \\nwith him, because we really had nothing left to lose at this point.\\nAfter we stopped using our credit cards, we spent a lot less! And \\nestablishing a budget highlighted the areas in which we had been blindly \\nwasting our money. We realized a lot of our expenses were due to eating \\nout and various luxury items that we could live without. We decided to \\ntake every extra dollar we had and pay off our credit card. Next we paid \\noff my car. Then we set up our emergency fund and began working on \\nour mortgage. Thankfully, we paid off the house a year and a half ahead \\nof schedule! While so many people don’t even realize the importance and \\nsense of fulfillment that come from owning your home, we found this to \\nbe the last and biggest step in finding true financial peace.\\nSince we’ve become debt-free, we have greatly enjoyed taking more \\nfamily vacations and spending time together.

I was there doing a radio appearance \\nand book signing when up walked Alicia, or “Al,” as she likes to be called.\\nAccording to her letter, Al’s story was typical but didn’t end normally. \\nShe and her husband started their Total Money Makeover at age twenty-five. \\nThey listened to me on our talk radio show and decided they’d had enough. \\nThey started with $20,000 in student loans, $10,000 in car loans, $3,000 \\nin credit-card debt, and an $85,000 mortgage: a grand total of $118,000 in \\ndebt. On a $70,000 annual household income, they paid off every red cent \\nin six years. At thirty-one years young, Al stood before me a smiling and free \\nwoman. She brought me one of my favorite gifts too. She brought me the \\nletter and a ziplock bag. What was in the bag? Fescue from her backyard, \\n“Because,” she said, “the grass really does feel different under my bare feet \\nin the backyard now that there is no mortgage and we are DEBT-FREE!”\\nI asked what she was going to do now that she was debt-free. Her \\nresponse was fun. She said she and her husband were going to dinner to \\ncelebrate. At dinner they were going to do two things. First, they were \\ngoing to read the menu from left to right for a change, because money is \\nnow no object. Second, at the celebration dinner they fully intended to \\nspend more than a car payment! You see, if you will live like no one else, \\nlater you can live like no one else.\\nNext, Al said she and her husband were on a direct course to the last \\nBaby Step and would give more than they had ever imagined they would \\nhave. At thirty-one, this couple is destined for extreme levels of wealth. \\nCongratulations, Al. You and your husband are true examples of what a \\nTotal Money Makeover looks like.'),\n",

It is instead a tremendous responsibility. So what would you \\ndo if you had $18 million that it took you forty years to acquire?\\nAfter years of studying, teaching, and even preaching on this subject \\nacross America, I can find only three good uses for money. Money is good \\nfor FUN. Money is good to INVEST. And money is good to GIVE. Most \\nanything else you find to do with it doesn’t represent good mental and spiri\\xad\\ntual health on your part.

Some days it seems my \\nanswer to every question is, “Sell the car.” “Don’t buy that new car,” is \\nadvice you will hear from me so often you’ll be saying it in your sleep.\\nSometimes a caller will ask if he can afford a purchase while on his Total \\nMoney Makeover. Sometimes a new listener wanders into the snare of ask\\xad\\ning about buying something totally ridiculous. I’m nice, at first, to explain \\nthat she can’t do that now. I’ll say something like, “The emergency fund is \\nmore important than a leather couch.” I have a computer in front of me while \\nI’m on the air, which the phone screener uses to tell me who is on hold and \\nwhat they are calling about. Not long ago I looked down at the screen and \\nsaw that Michael was waiting to talk with me. The note said he wanted to \\nbuy a Harley-Davidson motorcycle.

I usually ask a little about the caller’s financial situation in order to \\nmake a quasi-reasonable judgment, so I asked Michael what he made last \\nyear.

Sometimes I meet people who arrive at \\nthis step and are scared because just as they reach retirement age, their \\ninvestments are heading down. Never fear; if you have quality investments \\nwith long-term track records, they will come back. Besides, you don’t need \\nall the nest egg at once to retire on; you just need some of the income from \\nit. So since you don’t need it all right then, it would be silly to cash every\\xad\\nthing out while the market is at the bottom. “Buy high; sell low” is not the \\nformula to wealth. Be patient with the market while living off the income \\nthe nest egg produces.\\nYou can choose to be a little more sophisticated, but until you have \\nover $10 million, I would keep your investing very simple. You can clut\\xad\\nter your life with a bunch of unnecessary stress by getting into extremely \\ncomplex investments. I use simple mutual funds and debt-free real estate \\nas my investment mix—very clean, simple investments with some basic \\ntax advantages. As you arrive at this Baby Step, if you want to own some \\npaid-for real estate, it can be fun.\\nAlways manage your own money. You should surround yourself with \\na team of people smarter than you, but you make the decisions. You can \\ntell if they are smarter than you if they can explain complex issues in ways \\nyou can understand. If a member of your team wants you to do something \\n“because I say so,” get a new team member. You are not hiring a daddy; \\nyou are gathering counsel. God did not give them the responsibility over \\nthis money. He gave that to you. Celebrities and pro athletes often lose \\ntheir entire fortunes because they give up the responsibility of managing \\ntheir own money.

The wealthy person who is ruled by his stuff \\nis no freer than the debt-ridden consumer we have picked on throughout \\nthe book. Antoine Rivaroli said, “There are men who gain from their \\nwealth only the fear of losing it.”\\nSince you have read many pages learning a wealth-building system \\nfrom me, you might think that I believe stuff is the answer to happiness, \\nemotional well-being, and spiritual maturity. You would be wrong because \\nI know that is not the case. On the contrary, I see a real spiritual danger \\nto having great wealth. The danger is old-fashioned materialism. In his \\ngreat book Money, Possessions, and Eternity, author Randy Alcorn takes \\na probing look at materialism. Randy discusses a disease running amuck \\nin America: “Affluenza.” Affluenza is a malady that affects some of the \\naffluent and their children. Because some of the affluent and their chil\\xad\\ndren seek happiness, solace, and fulfillment in the consuming of stuff, they \\nface a problem. By trying to get stuff to do something it wasn’t designed \\nto do, they come up empty and end up depressed and even suicidal. They \\ndiscover bumper-sticker wisdom: “He who dies with the most toys is still \\ndead.” Stuff is wonderful; get some stuff, but don’t let the pursuit of wealth \\nbecome your god.\\nMy wife and I are concerned that our wealth could be a blessing and \\nnot a curse to our children. So we are tough on our kids regarding work, \\nsaving, giving, and spending issues. We expect a lot from them and have \\nsince they were small. I am very proud of the character of our children. \\nThey, like their parents, aren’t perfect, but they are doing well. When one \\nof my kids was a teenager, she complained to me, “Do you know how \\ntough it is being Dave Ramsey’s kid? Dad, you are so hard on us, making \\nus buy our own cars, manage our own checkbooks. You cut us no slack.” \\nI replied that we are tough on them because one day they will inherit our \\nwealth, and that wealth will either ruin their lives or become a tool for \\ngreat good.\\nMy kids, you, and I can have good things happen as a result of our \\nTotal Money Makeover only if we have the spiritual character to recognize'),\n",

We further must recognize \\nthat while wealth is very fun, it comes with great responsibility.\\nAnother paradox is that wealth will make you more of what you are. \\nLet that one soak in for a minute.

Many of the heroes of biblical faith, of \\nworld history, and of our nation were very wealthy, including King David, \\nSolomon, Job, and most of our Founding Fathers. There is a negative \\nmind-set justifying money mediocrity that is maddening. Wealth is not \\nevil, and people who possess it aren’t evil by virtue of the wealth. There \\nare rich jerks and poor jerks. Dallas Willard, in his book The Spirit of the \\nDisciplines, says to use riches is to cause them to be consumed, to trust in \\nriches is to count upon them for things they cannot provide, but to possess \\nriches is to have the right to say how they will or will not be used.\\nIf you are a good person, it is your spiritual duty to possess riches for \\nthe good of mankind. If you are a Christian like me, it is your spiritual \\nduty to possess riches so that you can do with them things that bring glory \\nto God. The bottom line is, if you take the stand that managing wealth is \\nevil or carnal, then by default you leave all the wealth to the evil, carnal \\npeople. If wealth is spiritually bad, then good people can’t have it, so all \\nthe bad people get it. It is the duty of the good people to get wealth to keep \\nit from the bad people because the good people will do good with it. If we \\nall abandon money because some misguided souls view it as evil, then the \\nonly ones with money will be the pornographer, the drug dealer, or the \\npimp. Simple enough?'),\n",

I see well-rounded, mature people who become all God designed \\nthem to be when they get their money closets cleaned out. God has a plan \\nfor your life, and that plan isn’t to harm you; it is a plan for your future to \\ngive you hope (see Jeremiah 29:11).\\nHope is what I want you to walk away with from this book.

We have a plan for that.\\nPro rata means “fair share.” Use this form to figure out what percentage of your income \\neach creditor represents, and then send their payment along with a copy of this form and \\nyour budget every month—even if they say they won’t accept it.\\nStep 1\\nSubtract Necessity Expense (B) from Household \\nIncome (A). That gives you your Disposable \\nIncome  (C). That’s how much money you have \\nto pay toward debt after you’ve covered all your \\nnecessities.\\nStep 2 \\nWrite in your Total Debt (d). Then collect all \\nyour bills and add up the grand total of all your \\nmonthly minimum payments. Write that in Total \\nMin. Payments (E). If your Total Min. Payments \\nfigure is higher than your Disposable Income (C) \\nfigure, you need to use the Pro Rata Debt List.\\nStep 3\\nList each debt in the Item (f) column and write the total debt payoff amount in the Payoff (G) column. Go \\nahead and write in the Total Debt (H) and Disposable Income—or Disp. Inc. (J)—amounts from the top of \\nthe form too.\\nStep 4\\nOn each line, divide the Payoff (G) by the Total Debt (H) to get the Percent (i). That figure shows you each \\ncreditor’s fair share of your available income.\\nStep 5\\nMultiply the Percent (i) by your total disposable income in the Disp. Inc. (J) column. Write that in the New \\nPmt. (K) column. That’s what you should send to that specific creditor. Repeat that math for every item on \\nthe list to calculate your pro rata payments for each one.\\nHousehold income\\nnecessity Expense\\ndisposable income\\n—\\n=\\nC\\nB\\nA\\nTotal debt\\nTotal Min.
